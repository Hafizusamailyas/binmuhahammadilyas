    <h2>Hafiz Saeed</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Hafiz Muhammad Saeed (Urdu: حافظ محمد سعید,</b> born 5 June 1950)[4] is a Pakistani Islamist[5][6] who co-founded Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),[7][8][9] a Pakistan-based Islamist militant organization that is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council,[10][11] India,[12] the United States,[13] the United Kingdom,[14] the European Union,[15] Australia,[16] and Russia.[17] He is listed on India's NIA Most Wanted.[18][19] In April 2012, the United States placed a bounty of US$10 million[20] on Saeed for his role in the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 civilians. While India officially supported the American move, there were protests against it in Pakistan.[21][22][23]After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, he was designated by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council.[24] He is also listed on the United States Department of the Treasury's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.[25]India has demanded that Saeed be handed over into Indian custody by Pakistan; however, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries.[26] Saeed has denied ever being a leader of LeT and has said all allegations that he planned attacks in India are baseless.[27][28]

        In July 2019, three months before the scheduled reviewal of Pakistan's action plan by the Financial Action Task Force, Saeed was arrested by Pakistani authorities and sentenced to an 11-year prison sentence.[29] In early April 2022, he was sentenced an additional 31 years for terror financing.[30]

        India has demanded that Saeed be handed over into Indian custody by Pakistan; however, there is no extradition agreement between the two countries.[26] Saeed has denied ever being a leader of LeT and has said all allegations that he planned attacks in India are baseless.[27][28]

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
        Saeed was born in Sargodha, Punjab, Pakistan.[31][32] As told by him, his father, Maulana Kamal-ud-Din, a religious scholar, landlord and farmer, along with his family started migrating from East Punjab and reached Pakistan in around four months in the autumn of 1947.[33] The family is of Gujjar background and three of his brothers, Hafiz Hamid, Hafiz Mastodon and Hafiz Hannan, are involved in Islamic activism as well, having previously run Islamic centres in Boston in the United States.[34]

        He was named hafiz because he memorized the Qur'an during his childhood, a time during which he was already enthusiastic about the verses on jihad. He then attended the Government College Sargodha (now University of Sargodha) before getting a Master's in Islamic Studies at the King Saud University in Riyadh.[35]
        
        A major early influence on his life and ideology was his maternal uncle, and later father-in-law, Hafiz Abdullah Bahawalpuri,[36] who was a famed theologian belonging to the Ahl-i Hadith, who held that democracy was incompatible with Islam (which alienated him with Maulana Maududi's Jamaat-e-Islami) and argued, on the importance of jihad, "that only in jihad does one offer one's life in the way of Allah, which elevates it to a higher plane than merely fulfilling other religious responsibilities such as saying prayers and paying zakat, also entailing sacrifices and adjustments, but not at the scale evident in jihad" and "considered shahadat (martyrdom) to be the crux of jihad."[37] Bahawalpuri's only son, Abdul Rehman Makki, is Saeed's brother-in-law and has been described as "his close partner."[38]

        General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq appointed Saeed to the Council on Islamic Ideology, and he later served as an Islamic Studies teacher at the University of Engineering and Technology, Pakistan.[32] He was sent to Saudi Arabia in the early 1980s by the university for higher studies where he met Saudi sheikhs who were taking part in the Soviet–Afghan War. They inspired him in taking an active role supporting the mujahideen in Afghanistan.[39] During his studies at the King Saud University, where he was gold medalist for his academic performances as well as taught there, he came under the influence of Salafi scholars like Shaykh Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen and especially Shaykh Ibn Baz.[40]
        
        Saeed held two master's degrees from the University of Punjab and a specialisation in Islamic Studies and Arabic Language from King Saud University.[41]
        
        In 1987, Saeed, along with Abdullah Azzam,Zafar Iqbal Shehbaz, founded Markaz Dawa-Wal-Irshad, a group with roots in the Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadis.[19][32]
        
        This organisation spawned the jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba in 1987,[32] with the help of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence officers.[42]
        
        Lashkar's primary target is the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir.[43]

    <h2>Family</h2>
    <p>Saeed's son Talha Saeed serves as the Lashkar-e-Taiba second-in-command. He controls the finances of Lashkar. In 2019, Talha escaped an assassination attempt when a bomb inside a refrigerator shop exploded in Lahore. According to Lashkar the bombing was attributed to the infighting in the Lashkar and R&AW.[44

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
    1994
    In 1994, Saeed visited the United States and "spoke at Islamic centres in Houston, Chicago and Boston".[45]
    
    2001–2002
    Pakistan took Saeed into custody on 21 December 2001 due to an Indian government assertion that he was involved in the 13 December 2001 attack on the Lok Sabha. He was held until 31 March 2002, released, then taken back into custody on 15 May. He was placed under house arrest on 31 October 2002 after his wife Maimoona Saeed sued the province of Punjab and the Pakistan federal government for what she claimed was an illegal detention.[46]2006
    After 11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the provincial government of Punjab, Pakistan arrested him on 9 August 2006 and kept him under house arrest but he was released on 28 August 2006 after a Lahore High Court order. He was arrested again on the same day by the provincial government and was kept in the Canal Rest House in Sheikhupura. He was finally released after the Lahore High Court order on 17 October 2006.[47][48]
    
    2008–2009
    After the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, India submitted a formal request to the U.N. Security Council to put the group Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Saeed on the list of individuals and organisations sanctioned by the United Nations for association with terrorism.[45] India has accused the organisation and its leader, Saeed, of being virtually interchangeable with Lashkar-e-Taiba. India said that the close links between the organisations, as well as the 2,500 offices and  11 seminaries that Jamaat-ud-Dawa maintains in Pakistan, "are of immediate concern with regard to their efforts to mobilise and orchestrate terrorist activities."[49] On 10 December 2008, Saeed denied a link between LeT and JuD in an interview with Pakistan's Geo television stating that "no Lashkar-e-Taiba man is in Jamaat-ud-Dawa and I have never been a chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba."[27]

    On 11 December 2008, Hafiz Muhammed Saeed was again placed under house arrest when the United Nations declared Jamaat-ud-Dawa to be an LeT front.[50] Saeed was held in house arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order law, which allows authorities to detain temporarily individuals deemed likely to create disorder,[50] until early June 2009 when the Lahore High Court, deeming the containment to be unconstitutional, ordered Saeed to be released.[51] India quickly expressed its disappointment with the decision.[51]
    
    On 6 July 2009, the Pakistani government filed an appeal of the court's decision. Deputy Attorney General Shah Khawar told the Associated Press that "Hafiz Saeed at liberty is a security threat."[52]
    
    On 25 August 2009, Interpol issued a red notice against Saeed, along with Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, in response to Indian requests for his extradition.[53]

    Saeed was again placed under house arrest by the Pakistani authorities in September 2009.[54]
    
    On 12 October 2009, the Lahore High Court quashed all cases against Saeed and set him free. The court also notified that Jama'at-ud-Da'wah is not a banned organisation and can work freely in Pakistan. Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, one of two judges hearing the case, observed "In the name of terrorism we cannot brutalise the law."[55]
